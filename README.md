## ItsAClock

This displays the current time (matching locale settings... in theory) without external dependencies.

I modified [Sam Wong's project](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/clock.566/) to not include [an external dependency](https://gist.github.com/sam0737/a0ee8ca253fc5c84b2aa2ac018f7b8ad), again, to simply get the time.

I mean no offense brother.... but wtf.
